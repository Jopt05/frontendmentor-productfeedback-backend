## Product Feedback App Backend
This is the backend for the *Product Feedback App* from Frontendmentor.io.

In this server I used Express based on classes and tried to segment all my code between routes, models, controllers and more.

I also used MongoDB as database and had a fun time learning some new stuff.

Also used Express Validator to improve the routes.
